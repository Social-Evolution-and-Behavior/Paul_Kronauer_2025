This directory contains: 

- A sample dataset from a representative experiment testing the behavior of 24 Young (12-day old) ants in the brood care assay.

- An image of the first frame of the film of this experiment

- The .mat output files of tracking the Ant and Larva with AnTrax found in /Sample_data_brood_care_assay/antrax/antdata.  The /antdata directory contains 24 subdirectories labeled C1 to C24, which contain the AnTrax .mat output files.  Those files are labeled xy_1_1.mat to xy_10_10.mat, each representing the tracked data from 10 movie files.

- The Code as Jupyter Notebooks, used to:

	1. Extract, load, and transform the tracking data from the AnTrax .mat output files
	2. Calculate and plot the Ant and Larva PositionData used to manually correct the frame of larva detection for each ant
	3. Calculate and plot the transition points between the P1 and P2 phase for each ant
	4. Calculate the P1 duration and P1, P2, and Total proportion of time the ant interacts with the larva

- The output files generated by running the four Code files. 


NOTE: the Code should be run in order from 1 to 4 to properly generate the expected output files found in /Sample_data_brood_care_assay/antrax/analysis

NOTE: to compare the outputs from running the code on your local system, be sure to save the output files to a different directory than /Sample_data_brood_care_assay/antrax/analysis 

This experiment and sample dataset is not published in Paul et al. 2025. However it accurately demonstrates the methods used to analyze all behavioral experiments in the publication.
